# Poker Strategy Simulator 🎴

A Python-based simulation and decision logic tool for analyzing poker hands.

This project models poker card combinations, supports rule-based decision making, and includes a visual probability distribution of poker hands. It serves as a foundational exercise in algorithmic reasoning, probabilistic thinking, and structured data modeling — essential skills in the field of Data Science and AI.
